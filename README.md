# Tiny-Web

The Tiny-Foxes Website, find all our repos, members and all our blogposts.

## Development

Everything is rendered client-side, this uses BootStrap 4.5.0, Tippy v5, Popper V1 and Jquery 3.5.1.

Most pages are generated dynamically with its associated JS file (such as "aboutScript" and "projectsScrip", they're executed as soon as the user enters the page)

My (moruzerinho6) skills with frontend are really weak and that's why the website looks so basic, every style is also made via JavaScript.
