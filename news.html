                &
                OutFox Community Team Aug 2021 Update</a> - 25/09/2021</h3>
        <p>It&#39;s September time! Welcome everyone, time to see your monthly blogpost, this month has been a bit chill
            as we&#39;re getting close to the end of 2021, now let&#39;s do this:</p>
        <h2 class="text-center" id="tinyfoxes-status">TinyFoxes Status</h2>
        <p>Speaking as the TinyFoxes creator, this project/organization has become bigger and more than I ever expected
            it to be, at the moment of writing this, we have <strong>43</strong> open source projects that range from
            translations to themes/noteskins/judgments/guides/tools/templates..etc. To think that this started as an
            organization to host OutFox language files, it obviously became more than that, and it reflects on the
            community vision of Tiny-Foxes.</p>
        <p>As a community manager of Project OutFox, I always keep a look at community comments, ideas, and how they see
            us and that gave me the opportunity to also see how TinyFoxes is seen as, some believe that it was created
            to control modding on OutFox so we can control the quality of those contents as an Alpha product, I want to
            clarify that this isn&#39;t my or OutFox Team intention, no content is forced to be on TinyFoxes to exist or
            to be considered by us, TinyFoxes is content approved and looked upon that will be showcased as officially
            verified community content, it&#39;s why we showcase at our <a
                href="https://projectoutfox.com/news/category/showcase">official website</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Anyone can submit content to TinyFoxes</strong>, you only need to contact the OutFox Team to verify
            if the content is allowed. Now, let&#39;s clarify some things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any content that is made for OutFox will be considered to join.</li>
            <li>Content that is not made for OutFox but works will also be considered, but we will expect maintaining
                content to be future proof. (For example: CMD removal)</li>
            <li>&quot;What is considered OutFox content/Allowed on TinyFoxes?&quot;<ul>
                    <li>Themes</li>
                    <li>Tools that interacts, creates, updates, deletes OutFox files.</li>
                    <li>Noteskins</li>
                    <li>Judgments</li>
                    <li>Chart Pack(s)</li>
                    <li>Announcers</li>
                    <li>BGAnimations</li>
                    <li>Backgrounds</li>
                    <li>Toasties</li>
                    <li>OutFox related Guides.</li>
                    <li>Programming code made for OutFox.</li>
                    <li>OutFox Documentation (Research also counts)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&quot;What is NOT considered OutFox content/Allowed on TinyFoxes?&quot;<ul>
                    <li>Exclusive SM5.1/5.2 or lower content made explicitly not to work on OutFox.</li>
                    <li>Non-original edits of created content.</li>
                    <li>Unlicensed content.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With that out of the way, I&#39;d like to announce that <strong>starting next year</strong>, TinyFoxes
            blogposts will be released every 4 months instead of each month, I hope this gives the community more time
            to finish their content before being featured.</p>

                OutFox Community Team Aug 2021 Update</a> - 28/08/2021</h3>
        <p>Hi everyone, what a busy month, we managed to get one of our biggest projects done and we&#39;re definitely
            gonna talk about that, so get ready to read!</p>
        <h2 class="text-center" id="outfox-serenity">OutFox Serenity</h2>
        <p>If you haven&#39;t seen it already, a community pack was in the works and is now released with <a
                href="https://projectmoon.dance/releases/5.3.0-alpha-4.9.10">OutFox Alpha 4.9.10</a>, the community team
            worked hard on this with the help from you to make this possible.</p>
        <p>You can read all about it <a href="https://projectmoon.dance/outfox-serenity">here</a>, but let&#39;s talk
            more about it, the progress, the problems we faced, and solutions, after all, transparency is the source of
            trust.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="the-announcement-of-a-community-pack">The announcement of a community pack</h3>
        <p>A new version of OutFox was coming, and it was one of our best-known versions yet, it added support for many
            gamemodes, new functions, new features, it was awesome and our team was also hyped about it so much that we
            came with the idea of a community pack after we saw the old attempts of it. We didn&#39;t really expect it
            to be as big as it is today but many people found the idea awesome so we ran with it.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="submissions">Submissions</h3>
        <p>Now that we know a community pack is what people expect we need to open the contributions, with the help from
            Lirodon we created a page to open content submissions (<a
                href="https://projectmoon.dance/community-pack-submissions">which is still open btw</a>) and saw the
            wave of people wanting to help, after some time we also created categories and channels for our Discord
            server as almost everyone who wanted to contribute was already there.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="chart-organization">Chart Organization</h3>
        <p>This is the part where things get a bit tricky, we had internal files for up-to-date submissions and
            templates for our members, it felt good enough at the start but we quickly saw the problem.</p>
        <p>Most submissions included other charts from notes that are not completed yet, attacks were also affecting
            charts from other people, speed mods, changes, warps, and we had to waste way more time than expected fixing
            that.</p>
        <p>An unexpected situation happened with one of our community members where helping us manage the content got
            almost impossible so we had less management than usual which made things slower.</p>
        <p>We also noticed some of our internal files were in an unexpected folder, and more than half the files were
            missing because of that, WHOOPS.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="the-testing-week">The testing week</h3>
        <p>After some time we were able to things done to launch a testing week were people to help find missing
            content/issues with release candidates, it was really important and helped us discover what we couldn&#39;t
            find.</p>
        <p>The first day was a bomb of issues, but it quickly turned into just a few issues here and there later, this
            means the community is active and helpful and we thank everyone for that, really.</p>
        <p>Oh wait a second, this is a community pack and it includes charts, charts have notes and people want to know
            how hard those notes are, this means...RATING!!</p>
        <p>Yes...we didn&#39;t have a standard rating yet, but thanks to our active community we quickly were able to
            decide one, for dance, it was very split with ITG and DDR X, we choose DDR as more concrete reasons were
            given for it. The community then helped by re-rating every chart for every mode, which you can see <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mdCiEKiBvrpQRNLPiO4vWwgPRJzD3qJ59COboT4JtVg/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>,
            again thanks to everyone for helping.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="music-license">Music license</h3>
        <p>Some content wasn&#39;t licensed with CC, it was only given as a right for Project OutFox to distribute,
            while is good enough for us to release a game with it, it isn&#39;t for us to <a
                href="https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox-Serenity">host on Github</a>, we choose to respect the artist
            license decision and remove individual files from music that do not include/use a CC license and improved
            our credits to reach out to more content of the artist.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="launch-">Launch!</h3>
        <p>With charts, graphics, music, everything ready we decided to launch the pack with next version of OutFox so
            branding content started to be made, Lirodon created <a

            which calls back to Serenity, our website was also changed to fit with those changes.</p>
        <h3 class="text-center" id="what-we-learned">What we learned</h3>
        <p>Making a pack is both fun and rewarding for both the team and the community, it requires great work but it
            sure pays off. For the next volume, we will be using our <a
                href="https://github.com/TeamRizu/OutFox-Serenity">Github repository</a> to better manage the files with
            the content creators so they can interact in real-time with the files we have. With the experience we got,
            expect fewer errors and more communication between you and the team on how everything is going, this is also
            true for OutFox Development Team.</p>

            konko-module-system (by <a href="https://github.com/Sudospective">Sudospective</a>)</h3>
        <p>Konko is a module system based on the Kitsu template that allows for beat-based tweens without a gameplay
            screen or even a song.</p>
        <p>Konko is object-oriented. You can create nodes that act as extended actors that can have beat-based tweens
            appended to them. You can also create a global-ready or update function to add beat-based tweens to existing
            nodes.</p>

        <p>Recently we released another community project to showcase the community NoteSkins, this means that if you

            be making blogposts of noteskins that do join, so reach out in our <a

                tool was still able to tell this is an OutFox install, that&#39;s because it looks at the file structure
                for the given installation and tries to deduce what it is.</p>

                subreddit</a> which is driven by the Moondance Staff who controls Tiny-Foxes. With that change, the new
            title for our posts will be changed to reflect for changes made by Moondance Projects as a whole and not
            only Tiny-Foxes, <strong>this means Tiny-Foxes will still be considered the biggest and most impotant topic
                of the posts</strong>, but Moondance Projects will also be a topic. </p>

        <p>If you are not aware of what Tiny-Foxes is, consider reading <a

                first</a>.</p>
        <p>It has been a long time since our last post (2 months) as most people took a break in January, but now we're
            in a new yeat with more exciting features coming to both Tiny-Foxes and StepMania OutFox.</p>
        <p>First of all, we now have a Tiny-Foxes Website where you can find our repositories, members, old posts and
            more to come. The Website is still very barebones and in works as its looks and features are still a work in
            progress. Now let's go with the new projects:</p>

                    that line in the .ini?" Now there's no need to wonder! This program will make a translator view file
                    for your translation .ini and make you translation job easier</i></p>

                target="_blank">Tiny-Foxes December 2020 Update</a> - 25/12/2020</h3>
        <p>If you ever wish to translate the <a href="https://projectmoon.dance/" target="_blank">Project MoonDance</a>
            website to your language then this is what you'll need.</p>
        <p>This is the last post of 2020 and I would like to share that I have no clue if one will be created for
            January of 2021, updates might come for OutFox Alpha V which is supposed to come in february but don't
            expect much more than translation updates since most people will be using their free time with their family
            (Just like me).</p>
        <p>Now, with the new projects!</p>

        <br />

        <ul>

            <p>Translate <a href="https://projectmoon.dance/" target="_blank">Project Moondance</a> just like how you
                translate StepMania and its themes with ini files! This removes almost every html code that would be
                needed in the manual translation of the website.</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/XML-Convert" target="_blank">XML-Convert</a> <strong>(Maintained
                    by <a href="https://github.com/XeroOl" target="_blank">XeroOl</a>)</strong></li>
            <p>XML-Convert is a tool to help convert OpenITG/NotITG song-specific xml files into lua files. In theory,
                it should work with any OS that can run lua, but it's only been tested on linux.</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/smtheme-soundwaves-community"

            <p>This is the <strong>community version</strong> of the current default theme of StepMania OutFox 5.3, this
                means that the community can toy with it for features and addons and Team Rizu will pull from it good
                features if necessary.</p>

            </li>
            <p>Got new features for translators:</p>
            <p>You can now sync your translation file with a reference file (usually the EN.ini).</p>
            <li>All lines in the reference file that are not in the target file will be added to the target file</li>
            <li>All lines in the target file that are not in the reference file will be removed</li>
            <li>Lines that are in both, but at different places, will be reordered to follow the reference file's order.
            </li>
            <br />
            <p>Added a new tool: The Lines Counter</p>
            <p>It compares 2 files, and tells you how many files in the target file are different (and thus translated)
                than the reference file. It then prints the total number of lines to be translated, and the total number
                of lines already translated.</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, I'm here again to show our monthly progress as usual, this month we had way more people
            joining us so I have to thank you all for giving us this support, and me personally for helping me be part

        <p>It has been a month and a lot of things have happened with Tiny-Foxes, first I'll announce that I will be
            doing this monthly update so I don't spam this reddit with new projects, 30 days should be a good interval
            for this.</p>

        <p>Now I would like to clarify some things about Tiny-Foxes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>For you content to be hosted there, <strong>it needs to support OutFox</strong>, if your content works
                in 5.0/5.1 but blocks 5.3, then you won't be accepted. There's no problem to support other versions or
                games, but it needs to support 5.3 atleast.</li>
            <li>You still own the code/content of your project even when it's hosted on Tiny-Foxes, you should and will
                be credited when mentioned, if not, please report.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />

                target="_blank">Tiny-Foxes</a> - 26/09/2020</h3>
        <p>With <a href="https://projectmoon.dance/" target="_blank">Project OutFox</a> (StepMania 5.3) in the works,
            and reviving the StepMania community back together, many little projects have started to make content for
            it, and to add more features that don't have to deal with older versions of StepMania with its bad code
            practices, because of that, I created <a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes" target="_blank">Tiny-Foxes</a>
            which is a community run project to support and help community content.</p>
        <p>Initially, it was a place to store translations for OutFox, but Team Rizu and its community decided to give
            me more support than I could have ever thought of getting.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of projects that we have done for now:</p>
        <br />

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/OutFox-Translations" target="_blank">OutFox-Translations</a></li>
            <p>Where we host official strings that goes to OutFox itself.</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/Translation-Toolkit" target="_blank">Translation-Toolkit</a></li>
            <p>A translation tool made by <a href="https://github.com/Ksempac" target="_blank">Ksempac</a> to help
                organize and make translators life easier, more functions are yet to come so be sure to keep an eye on
                it!</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/sm5-legacy" target="_blank">sm5-legacy (StepMania 5.0.12 default
                    theme "CircoCero")</a></li>
            <p>A version of CircoCero more optimized for OutFox maintained by <a href="https://github.com/JoseVarelaP"
                    target="_blank">Jose_Varela</a>, one of <a href="https://github.com/TeamRizu" target="_blank">Team
                    Rizu</a> members and popular theme maker.</p>

            <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/Judge" target="_blank">Judge</a></li>

            <li><a href="SoundWaves-Colors" target="_blank">SoundWaves-Colors</a></li>
            <p>A project I started recently so people can host their custom color schemes that SoundWaves enables you to
                make. (Note: SoundWaves is the name of Project OutFox default theme)</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>And of course we have a lot of awesome people who are helping StepMania to be more accessible for those who
            don't speak English:</p>
